# Google Books Search

### Overview

In this activity, I created a React-based Google Books Search app. This project is not fully functiong as of yet. I am currently working to successfully establish a connection with the google books api

### User Story
As an avid reader who frequently shops for ebooks...
I WANT to be able to search under the available books on the online google bookstore SO THAT I can view the books to buy or to save for a later purchase.
I WANT to be able to view by saved books SO THAT I can have a stored place for all my favortie books
